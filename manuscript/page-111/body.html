His earlier books, <em>An Ocean Tramp</em> and <em>Aliens</em> (both republished since), had gone almost unnoticed—which, it is safe to say, will not happen again to anything he cares to publish. His later books are <em>Captain Macedoine's Daughter</em>, <em>Harbours of Memory</em>, and <em>An Engineer's Notebook</em>. He was born at sea in 1881, the son of a sea-captain; grew up in a northern suburb of London, served his apprenticeship in a big engineering shop, and has been in ships most of the time since 1905.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">THERE is a sharp, imperative rap on my outer door;</p></div> </div>
