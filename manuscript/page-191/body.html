He is an infectious fellow: if you read him much you will find yourself trying to imitate him; there is no harm in doing so: he himself caught the trick from Rabelais. I do not propose to rehash here the essay I wrote about him in a book called <em>Shandygaff</em>. You can refer to it there, which will be good business all round. I know it is a worthy essay, for much of it was cribbed</p></div> </div>
