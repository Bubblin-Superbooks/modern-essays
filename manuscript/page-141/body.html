<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>A Familiar Preface</h3><h4>Joseph Conrad</h4><p class="  start-chapter">This glorious expression of the credo of all artists, in whatever form of creation, lastingly enriches the English tongue. It is from the preface to <em>A Personal Record</em>, that fascinating autobiographical volume in which Conrad tells the curious story of a Polish boy who ran away to sea and began to write in English. As a companion piece, those who have the honor of the writer's craft at heart should read Conrad's preface to <em>The Nigger of the Narcissus</em>.</p></div> </div>
