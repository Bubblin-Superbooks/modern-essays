When gathering the contents of this book I tried <em>Who's Who</em> again, still without result I wrote to Mr. Firkins pleading for biographical details; modestly, but firmly, he denied me.</p><p>So all I can tell you is this, that Mr. Firkins is to my mind one of the half-dozen most sparkling critics in this country. One sometimes feels that he is carried a little past his destination by the sheer gusto and hilarity of his antitheses and paradoxes. That is not so, however, in this essay about O. Henry, an author who has often been grotesquely mispraised (I did not say overpraised) by people incompetent to appreciate his true greatness. Mr. Robert Cortes Holliday, in an essay called "The Amazing Failure of O. Henry," said that O. Henry created no memorable characters. Mr. Firkins suggests the obvious but satisfying answerâ€”New York itself is his triumph. The New York of O. Henry, already almost erased physically, remains a personality and an identity.</p></div> </div>
