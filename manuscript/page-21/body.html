<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Mead and Company for Simeon Strunsky's <em>Nocturne</em>, from his volume <em>Post-Impressions</em>; the Macmillan Company for <em>Beer and Cider</em>, from Professor Saintsbury's <em>Notes on a Cellar Book</em>; Longmans Green and Company for Bertrand Russell's <em>A Free Man's Worship</em>, from <em>Mysticism and Logic</em>; Robert M. McBride and Company for the selection from James Branch Cabell; Harcourt, Brace and Company for the essay by Heywood Broun; <em>The Weekly Review</em> for the essays by O. W. Firkins, Harry Morgan Ayres and Robert Palfrey Utter. The present ownership of the copyright of the essay by Louise Imogen Guiney I have been unable to discover. It was published in <em>Patrins</em> (Copeland and Day, 1897), which has long been out of print. Knowing the purity of my motives I have used this essay, hoping that it might introduce Miss Guiney's exquisite work to the younger generation that knows her hardly at all.</p></div> </div>
