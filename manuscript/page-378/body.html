You begin to think of your blankets. In a few moments you roll yourself in their soft wool. Instantly it is morning.</p><p>And, strange to say, you have not to pay by going through the day unrefreshed. You may feel like turning in at eight instead of nine, and you may fall asleep with unusual promptitude, but your journey will begin clear-headedly, proceed springily, and end with much in reserve. No languor, no dull headache, no exhaustion, follows your experience. For this once your two hours of sleep have been as effective as nine.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
