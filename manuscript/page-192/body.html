<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">from an article by Mr. Thomas Seccombe, which an American paper lifted from the English journal which, presumably, paid Mr. Seccombe for it. I wrote it for the Boston <em>Transcript</em>, where I knew the theft would be undetected; and in shoveling together some stuff for a book (that was in 1917, the cost of living was rising at an angle of forty-five degrees, as so many graphs have shown) I put it in, forgetting (until too late) that some of it was absolute plunder.</p><p>Mr. Chesterton once said something like this: "It is a mistake to think that thieves do not respect property. They only wish it to become <em>their</em> property, so that they may more perfectly respect it."</p><p>And by the way, Max Beerbohm's parody of Belloc, in <em>A Christmas Garland</em>, is something not to be missed. It is one of the best proofs that Belloc is a really great artist. Beerbohm does not waste his time mimicking the small fry.</p></div> </div>
