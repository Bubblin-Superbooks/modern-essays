And with the curiosity of the American and the enthusiasm of the Irish we lumbered downstairs in quest of Sergeant Reilly.</p><p>He was sitting on a low bench by the fire. His shoes were off and his bruised feet were in a pail of cold water. He was too good a soldier to expose them to the heat at once. The little girl was on his lap and the little boys stood by and envied him. And in a voice that twenty years of soldiering and oceans of whisky had failed to rob of its Celtic sweetness, he was softly singing: "Ireland Isn't Ireland Any More." We listened respectfully.</p><p>"They cheer the King and then salute him," said Sergeant Reilly.</p><p>"A regular Irishman would shoot him," and we all joined in the chorus, "Ireland Isn't Ireland Any More."</p></div> </div>
