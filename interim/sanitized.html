<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p>IT had been my habit, I am now aware, to speak somewhat lightly of the labors of anthologists: to insinuate that they led lives of bland sedentary ease. I shall not do so again. When the publisher suggested a collection of representative contemporary essays, I thought it would be the most lenient of tasks. But experience is a fine aperitive to the mind.</p>
<p>Indeed the pangs of the anthologist, if he has conscience, are burdensome. There are so many considerations to be tenderly weighed; personal taste must sometimes be set aside in view of the general plan; for every item chosen half a dozen will have been affectionately conned and sifted; and perhaps some favorite pieces will be denied because the authors have reasons for withholding permission. It would be enjoyable (for me, at any rate) to write an essay on the things I have lingered over with intent to include them in this little book, but have finally sacrificed for one reason or another. How many times—twenty at least—I have taken down from my shelf Mr. Chesterton&#39;s <em>The Victorian Age in Literature</em> to reconsider whether his ten pages on Dickens, or his glorious summing-up of Decadents and �sthetes, were not absolutely essential. How many times I have palpitated upon certain passages in <em>The Education of Henry Adams</em> and in Mr. Wells&#39;s <em>Outline of History</em>, which, I assured myself, would legitimately stand as essays if shrewdly excerpted.</p>
<p>But I usually concluded that would not be quite fair. I have not been overscrupulous in this matter, for the essay is a mood rather than a form; the frontier between the essay and the short story is as imperceptible as is at present the once famous Mason and Dixon line. Indeed, in that pleasant lowland country between the two empires lie (to my way of thinking) some of the most fertile fields of prose—fiction that expresses feeling and character and setting rather than action and plot; fiction beautifully ripened by the lingering mild sunshine of the essayist&#39;s mood. This is fiction, I might add, extremely unlikely to get into the movies. I think of short stories such as George Gissing&#39;s, in that too little known volume <em>The House of Cobwebs</em>, which I read again and again at midnight with unfailing delight; fall asleep over; forget; and again re-read with undiminished satisfaction. They have no brilliance of phrase, no smart surprises, no worked-up &#39;situations&#39; which have to be taken at high speed to pass without breakdown over their brittle bridgework of credibility. They have only the modest and faintly melancholy savor of life itself.</p>
<p>Yet it is a mere quibble to pretend that the essay does not have easily recognizable manners. It may be severely planned, or it may ramble in ungirdled mood, but it has its own point of view that marks it from the short story proper, or the merely personal memoir. That distinction, easily felt by the sensitive reader, is not readily expressible. Perhaps the true meaning of the word _essay_—an attempt—gives a clue. No matter how personal or trifling the topic may be, there is always a tendency to generalize, to walk round the subject or the experience, and view it from several vantages; instead of (as in the short story) cutting a carefully landscaped path through a chosen tract of human complication. So an essay can never be more than an attempt, for it is an excursion into the endless. Any student of fiction will admit that in the composition of a short story many entertaining and valuable elaborations may rise in the mind of the author which must be strictly rejected because they do not forward the essential motive. But in the essay (of an informal sort) we ask not relevance to plot, but relevance to mood. That is why there are so many essays that are mere marking time. The familiar essay is easier to write than the short story, but it imposes equal restraints on a scrupulous author. For in fiction the writer is controlled and limited and swept along by his material; but in the essay, the writer rides his pen. A good story, once clearly conceived, almost writes itself; but essays are written.</p>
<p>There also we find a pitfall of the personal essay—the temptation to become too ostentatiously quaint, too deliberately &#39;whimsical&#39; (the word which, by loathsome repetition, has become emetic). The fine flavor and genius of the essay—as in Bacon and Montaigne, Lamb, Hazlitt, Thackeray, Thoreau; perhaps even in Stevenson—is the rich bouquet of personality. But soliloquy must not fall into monologue. One might put it thus: that the perfection of the familiar essay is a conscious revelation of self done inadvertently.</p>
<p>The art of the anthologist is the art of the host: his tact is exerted in choosing a congenial group; making them feel comfortable and at ease; keeping the wine and tobacco in circulation; while his eye is tenderly alert down the bright vista of tablecloth, for any lapse in the general cheer. It is well, also, for him to hold himself discreetly in the background, giving his guests the pleasure of clinching the jape, and seeking only, by innocent wiles, to draw each one into some characteristic and felicitous vein. I think I can offer you, in this parliament of philomaths, entertainment of the most genuine sort; and having said so much, I might well retire and be heard no more.</p>
<p>But I think it is well to state, as even the most bashful host may do, just why this particular company has been called together. My intention is not merely to please the amiable dilettante, though I hope to do that too. I made my choices, first and foremost, with a view to stimulating those who are themselves interested in the arts of writing. I have, to be frank, a secret ambition that a book of this sort may even be used as a small but useful weapon in the classroom. I wanted to bring it home to the student that as brilliant and sincere work is being done to-day in the essay as in any period of our literature. Accordingly the pieces reprinted here are very diverse. There is the grand manner; there is foolery; there is straightforward literary criticism; there is pathos, politics, and the picturesque. But every selection is, in its own way, a work of art. And I would call the reader&#39;s attention to this: that the greater number of these essays were written not by retired �sthetes, but by practising journalists in the harness of the daily or weekly press. The names of some of the most widely bruited essayists of our day are absent from this roster, not by malice, but because I desired to include material less generally known.</p>
<p>I should apologize, I suppose, for the very informal tone of the introductory notes on each author. But I conceived the reader in the r�le of a friend spending the evening in happy gossip along the shelves. Pulling out one&#39;s favorites and talking about them, now and then reading a chosen extract aloud, and ending (some time after midnight) by choosing some special volume for the guest to take to bed with him—in the same spirit I have compiled this collection. Perhaps the editorial comments have too much the manner of dressing gown and slippers; but what a pleasant book this will be to read in bed!</p>
<p>And perhaps this collection may be regarded as a small contribution to Anglo-American friendliness. Of course when I say Anglo-, I mean Brito-, but that is such a hideous prefix. Journalists on this side are much better acquainted with what their professional colleagues are doing in Britain, than they with our concerns. But surely there should be a congenial fraternity of spirit among all who use the English tongue in print. There are some of us who even imagine a day when there may be regular international exchanges of journalists, as there have been of scholars and students. The contributions to this book are rather evenly divided between British and American hands; and perhaps it is not insignificant that two of the most pleasing items come from Canada, where they often combine the virtues of both sides.</p>
<p>It is a pleasant task to thank the authors and publishers who have assented to the reprinting of these pieces. To the authors themselves, and to the following publishers, I admit my sincere gratitude for the use of material copyrighted by them:—Doubleday Page and Company for the extracts from books by John Macy, Stewart Edward White and Pearsall Smith; Charles Scribner&#39;s Sons for Rupert Brooke&#39;s <em>Niagara Falls</em>; the New York <em>Sun</em> for Don Marquis&#39;s <em>Almost Perfect State</em>; the George H. Doran Company for the essays by Joyce Kilmer and Robert Cortes Holliday; Mr. James B. Pinker for permission to reprint Mr. Conrad&#39;s Preface to <em>A Personal Record</em>; Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., for the essays by H. M. Tomlinson, A. P. Herbert and Philip Guedalla; Lady Osler for the essay by the late Sir William Osler; Henry Holt and Company for Thomas Burke&#39;s <em>The Russian Quarter</em>; E. P. Dutton and Company for <em>A Word for Autumn</em>, by A. A. Milne; the New York <em>Evening Post</em> for the essays by Stuart P. Sherman and Harry Esty Dounce; Harper and Brothers for Marian Storm&#39;s <em>A Woodland Valentine</em>; Dodd, Mead and Company for Simeon Strunsky&#39;s <em>Nocturne</em>, from his volume <em>Post-Impressions</em>; the Macmillan Company for <em>Beer and Cider</em>, from Professor Saintsbury&#39;s <em>Notes on a Cellar Book</em>; Longmans Green and Company for Bertrand Russell&#39;s <em>A Free Man&#39;s Worship</em>, from <em>Mysticism and Logic</em>; Robert M. McBride and Company for the selection from James Branch Cabell; Harcourt, Brace and Company for the essay by Heywood Broun; <em>The Weekly Review</em> for the essays by O. W. Firkins, Harry Morgan Ayres and Robert Palfrey Utter. The present ownership of the copyright of the essay by Louise Imogen Guiney I have been unable to discover. It was published in <em>Patrins</em> (Copeland and Day, 1897), which has long been out of print. Knowing the purity of my motives I have used this essay, hoping that it might introduce Miss Guiney&#39;s exquisite work to the younger generation that knows her hardly at all.</p>

<p>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Personal Record.</em>
William Sidney Porter, 1862-1910, son of Algernon Sidney Porter, physician, was born, bred, and meagerly educated in Greensboro, North Carolina. In Greensboro he was drug clerk; in Texas he was amateur ranchman, land-office clerk, editor, and bank teller. Convicted of misuse of bank funds on insufficient evidence (which he supplemented by the insanity of flight), he passed three years and three months in the Ohio State Penitentiary at Columbus. Release was the prelude to life in New York, to story-writing, to rapid and wide-spread fame. Latterly, his stories, published in New York journals and in book form, were consumed by the public with an avidity which his premature death, in 1910, scarcely checked. The pen-name, O. Henry, is almost certainly borrowed from a French chemist Etienne-Ossian Henry, whose abridged name he fell upon in his pharmacal researches. See the interesting &quot;O. Henry Biography&quot; by C. Alphonso Smith.
O Henry&#39;s stories have been known to coincide with earlier work in a fashion which dims the novelty of the tale without clouding the originality of the author. I thought the brilliant &quot;Harlem Tragedy&quot; (in the &quot;Trimmed Lamp&quot;) unique through sheer audacity, but the other day I found its motive repeated with singular exactness in Montesquieu&#39;s &quot;Lettres Persanes&quot; (Letter LI).
&quot;These views, as usual, pleased some more, others less; some chid and calumniated me, and laid it to me as a crime that I had dared to depart from the precepts and opinions of all Anatomists.&quot;—De Motu Cordis, chap. i.
This visit (in the early eighties) had another relish. The inn coffee-room had a copy of Mr. Freeman&#39;s book on the adjoining Cathedral, and this was copiously annotated in a beautiful and scholarly hand, but in a most virulent spirit. &quot;Why can&#39;t you call things by their plain names?&quot; (in reference to the historian&#39;s Macaulayesque periphrases) etc. I have often wondered who the annotator was.
When I went up this March to help man the last ditch for Greek, I happened to mention &quot;Archdeacon&quot;: and my interlocutor told me that he believed no college now brewed within its walls. After the defeat, I thought of the stages of the Decline and Fall of Things: and how a sad but noble ode might be written (by the right man) on the Fates of Greek and Beer at Oxford. He would probably refer in the first strophe to the close of the Eumenides; in its antistrophe to Mr. Swinburne&#39;s great adaptation thereof in regard to Carlyle and Newman; while the epode and any reduplication of the parts would be occupied by showing how the departing entities were of no equivocal magnificence like the Eumenides themselves; of no flawed perfection (at least as it seemed to their poet) like the two great English writers, but wholly admirable and beneficent—too good for the generation who would banish them, and whom they banished.
This was one of the best illustrations of the old phrase, &quot;a good pennyworth,&quot; that I ever knew for certain. I add the two last words because of a mysterious incident of my youth. I and one of my sisters were sitting at a window in a certain seaside place when we heard, both of us distinctly and repeatedly, this mystic street cry: &quot;A bible and a pillow-case for a penny!&quot; I rushed downstairs to secure this bargain, but the crier was now far off, and it was too late.
By the way, are they still as good for flip at New College, Oxford, as they were in the days when it numbered hardly any undergraduates except scholars, and one scholar of my acquaintance had to himself a set of three rooms and a garden? And is &quot;The Island&quot; at Kennington still famous for the same excellent compound?
It came from Alford, the chef-lieu, if it cannot be called the capital, of the Tennyson country. I have pleasant associations with the place, quite independent of the beery ones. And it made me, partially at least, alter one of the ideas of my early criticism—that time spent on a poet&#39;s local habitations was rather wasted. I have always thought &quot;The Dying Swan&quot; one of its author&#39;s greatest things, and one of the champion examples of pure poetry in English literature. But I never fully heard the &quot;eddying song&quot; that &quot;flooded&quot; the creeping mosses and clambering weeds,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the willow branches hoar and dank,</p>
<p>And the wavy swell of the soughing reeds.</p>
<p>And the wave-worn horns of the echoing bank,</p>
<p>And the silvery marish-flowers that throng</p>
<p>The desolate creeks and pools among—</p>
<p>till I saw them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Herefordshire and Worcestershire cider can be very strong and the perry, they say, still stronger.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN LITERATURE</h3>
<h4>John Macy</h4>
<p>This vigorous survey of American letters is the first chapter of John Macy&#39;s admirable volume <em>The Spirit of American Literature</em>, published in 1913—a book shrewd, penetrating and salty, which has unfortunately never reached one-tenth of the many readers who would find it permanently delightful and profitable. Mr. Macy has no skill in vaudeville tricks to call attention to himself: no shafts of limelight have followed him across the stage. But those who have an eye for criticism that is vivacious without bombast, austere without bitterness, keen without malice, know him as one of the truly competent and liberal-minded observers of the literary scene.</p>
<p>Mr. Macy was born in Detroit, 1877; graduated from Harvard in 1899; did editorial service on the <em>Youth&#39;s Companion</em> and the <em>Boston Herald</em>; and nowadays lives pensively in Greenwich Village, writing a good deal for <em>The Freeman</em> and <em>The Literary Review</em>. Perhaps, if you were wandering on Fourth Street, east of Sixth Avenue, you might see him treading thoughtfully along, with a wide sombrero hat, and always troubled by an iron-gray forelock that droops over his brow. You would know, as soon as you saw him, that he is a man greatly lovable. I like to think of him as I first saw him, some years ago, in front of the bright hearth of the charming St. Botolph Club in Boston, where he was usually the center of an animated group of nocturnal philosophers.</p>
<p>The essay was written in 1912, before the very real reawakening of American creative work that began in the &#39;teens of this century. The reader will find it interesting to consider how far Mr. Macy&#39;s remarks might be modified if he were writing to-day.</p>
<p><em>The Spirit of American Literature</em> has been reissued in an inexpensive edition by Boni and Liveright. It is a book well worth owning.</p>
<p>AMERICAN literature is a branch of English literature, as truly as are English books written in Scotland or South Africa. Our literature lies almost entirely in the nineteenth century when the ideas and books of the western world were freely interchanged among the nations and became accessible to an increasing number of readers. In literature nationality is determined by language rather than by blood or geography. M. Maeterlinck, born a subject of King Leopold, belongs to French literature. Mr. Joseph Conrad, born in Poland, is already an English classic. Geography, much less important in the nineteenth century than before, was never, among modern European nations, so important as we sometimes are asked to believe. Of the ancestors of English literature &quot;Beowulf&quot; is scarcely more significant, and rather less graceful, than our tree-inhabiting forebears with prehensile toes; the true progenitors of English literature are Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Italian, and French.</p>
<p>American literature and English literature of the nineteenth century are parallel derivatives from preceding centuries of English literature. Literature is a succession of books from books. Artistic expression springs from life ultimately but not immediately. It may be likened to a river which is swollen throughout its course by new tributaries and by the seepages of its banks; it reflects the life through which it flows, taking color from the shores; the shores modify it, but its power and volume descend from distant headwaters and affluents far up stream. Or it may be likened to the race-life which our food nourishes or impoverishes, which our individual circumstances foster or damage, but which flows on through us, strangely impersonal and beyond our power to kill or create.</p>
<p>It is well for a writer to say: &quot;Away with books! I will draw my inspiration from life!&quot; For we have too many books that are simply better books diluted by John Smith. At the same time, literature is not born spontaneously out of life. Every book has its literary parentage, and students find it so easy to trace genealogies that much criticism reads like an Old Testament chapter of &quot;begats.&quot; Every novel was suckled at the breasts of older novels, and great mothers are often prolific of an�mic offspring. The stock falls off and revives, goes a-wandering, and returns like a prodigal. The family records get blurred. But of the main fact of descent there is no doubt.</p>
<p>American literature is English literature made in this country. Its nineteenth-century characteristics are evident and can be analyzed and discussed with some degree of certainty. Its &quot;American&quot; characteristics—no critic that I know has ever given a good account of them. You can define certain peculiarities of American politics, American agriculture, American public schools, even American religion. But what is uniquely American in American literature? Poe is just as American as Mark Twain; Lanier is just as American as Whittier. The American spirit in literature is a myth, like American valor in war, which is precisely like the valor of Italians and Japanese. The American, deluded by a falsely idealized image which he calls America, can say that the purity of Longfellow represents the purity of American home life. An Irish Englishman, Mr. Bernard Shaw, with another falsely idealized image of America, surprised that a face does not fit his image, can ask: &quot;What is Poe doing in that galley?&quot; There is no answer. You never can tell. Poe could not help it. He was born in Boston, and lived in Richmond, New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia. Professor van Dyke says that Poe was a maker of &quot;decidedly un-American cameos,&quot; but I do not understand what that means. Facts are uncomfortable consorts of prejudices and emotional generalities; they spoil domestic peace, and when there is a separation they sit solid at home while the other party goes. Irving, a shy, sensitive gentleman, who wrote with fastidious care, said: &quot;It has been a matter of marvel, to European readers, that a man from the wilds of America should express himself in tolerable English.&quot; It is a matter of marvel, just as it is a marvel that Blake and Keats flowered in the brutal city of London a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The literary mind is strengthened and nurtured, is influenced and mastered, by the accumulated riches of literature. In the last century the strongest thinkers in our language were Englishmen, and not only the traditional but the contemporary influences on our thinkers and artists were British. This may account for one negative characteristic of American literature—its lack of American quality. True, our records must reflect our life. Our poets, enamored of nightingales and Persian gardens, have not altogether forgotten the mocking-bird and the woods of Maine. Fiction, written by inhabitants of New York, Ohio, and Massachusetts, does tell us something of the ways of life in those mighty commonwealths, just as English fiction written by Lancashire men about Lancashire people is saturated with the dialect, the local habits and scenery of that county. But wherever an English-speaking man of imagination may dwell, in Dorset or Calcutta or Indianapolis, he is subject to the strong arm of the empire of English literature; he cannot escape it; it tears him out of his obscure bed and makes a happy slave of him. He is assigned to the department of the service for which his gifts qualify him, and his special education is undertaken by drill-masters and captains who hail from provinces far from his birthplace.</p>
<p>Dickens, who writes of London, influences Bret Harte, who writes of California, and Bret Harte influences Kipling, who writes of India. Each is intensely local in subject matter. The affinity between them is a matter of temperament, manifested, for example, in the swagger and exaggeration characteristic of all three. California did not &quot;produce&quot; Bret Harte; the power of Dickens was greater than that of the Sierras and the Golden Gate. Bret Harte created a California that never existed, and Indian gentlemen, Caucasian and Hindoo, tell us that Kipling invented an army and an empire unknown to geographers and war-offices.</p>
<p>The ideas at work among these English men of letters are world-encircling and fly between book and brain. The dominant power is on the British Islands, and the prevailing stream of influence flows west across the Atlantic. Sometimes it turns and runs the other way. Poe influenced Rossetti; Whitman influenced Henley. For a century Cooper has been in command of the British literary marine. Literature is reprehensibly unpatriotic, even though its votaries are, as individual citizens, afflicted with local prides and hostilities. It takes only a dramatic interest in the guns of Yorktown. Its philosophy was nobly uttered by Gaston Paris in the Coll�ge de France in 1870, when the city was beleaguered by the German armies: &quot;Common studies, pursued in the same spirit, in all civilized countries, form, beyond the restrictions of diverse and often hostile nationalities, a great country which no war profanes, no conqueror menaces, where souls find that refuge and unity which in former times was offered them by the city of God.&quot; The catholicity of English language and literature transcends the temporal boundaries of states.</p>
<p>What, then, of the &quot;provincialism&quot; of the American province of the empire of British literature? Is it an observable general characteristic, and is it a virtue or a vice? There is a sense in which American literature is not provincial enough. The most provincial of all literature is the Greek. The Greeks knew nothing outside of Greece and needed to know nothing. The Old Testament is tribal in its provinciality; its god is a local god, and its village police and sanitary regulations are erected into eternal laws. If this racial localism is not essential to the greatness of early literatures, it is inseparable from them; we find it there. It is not possible in our cosmopolitan age and there are few traces of it in American books. No American poet has sung of his neighborhood with na�ve passion, as if it were all the world to him. Whitman is pugnaciously American, but his sympathies are universal, his vision is cosmic; when he seems to be standing in a city street looking at life, he is in a trance, and his spirit is racing with the winds.</p>
<p>The welcome that we gave Whitman betrays the lack of an admirable kind of provincialism; it shows us defective in local security of judgment. Some of us have been so anxiously abashed by high standards of European culture that we could not see a poet in our own back yard until European poets and critics told us he was there. This is queerly contradictory to a disposition found in some Americans to disregard world standards and proclaim a third-rate poet as the Milton of Oshkosh or the Shelley of San Francisco. The passage in Lowell&#39;s &quot;Fable for Critics&quot; about &quot;The American Bulwers, Disraelis and Scotts&quot; is a spoonful of salt in the mouth of that sort of gaping village reverence.</p>
<p>Of dignified and self-respecting provincialism, such as Professor Royce so eloquently advocates, there might well be more in American books. Our poets desert the domestic landscape to write pseudo-Elizabethan dramas and sonnets about Mont Blanc. They set up an artificial Tennyson park on the banks of the Hudson. Beside the shores of Lake Michigan they croon the love affairs of an Arab in the desert and his noble steed. This is not a very grave offence, for poets live among the stars, and it makes no difference from what point of the earth&#39;s surface they set forth on their aerial adventures. A Wisconsin poet may write very beautifully about nightingales, and a New England Unitarian may write beautifully about cathedrals; if it is beautiful, it is poetry, and all is well.</p>
<p>The novelists are the worst offenders. There have been few of them; they have not been adequate in numbers or in genius to the task of describing the sections of the country, the varied scenes and habits from New Orleans to the Portlands. And yet, small band as they are, with great domestic opportunities and responsibilities, they have devoted volumes to Paris, which has an able native corps of story-makers, and to Italy, where the home talent is first-rate. In this sense American literature is too globe-trotting, it has too little savor of the soil.</p>
<p>Of provincialism of the narrowest type American writers, like other men of imagination, are not guilty to any reprehensible degree. It is a vice sometimes imputed to them by provincial critics who view literature from the office of a London weekly review or from the lecture rooms of American colleges. Some American writers are parochial, for example, Whittier. Others, like Mr. Henry James, are provincial in outlook, but cosmopolitan in experience, and reveal their provinciality by a self-conscious internationalism. Probably English and French writers may be similarly classified as provincial or not. Mr. James says that Poe&#39;s collection of critical sketches &quot;is probably the most complete and exquisite specimen of <em>provincialism</em> ever prepared for the edification of men.&quot; It is nothing like that. It is an example of what happens when a hack reviewer&#39;s work in local journals is collected into a volume because he turns out to be a genius. The list of Poe&#39;s victims is not more remarkable for the number of nonentities it includes than &quot;The Lives of the Poets&quot; by the great Doctor Johnson, who was hack for a bookseller, and &quot;introduced&quot; all the poets that the taste of the time encouraged the bookseller to print. Poe was cosmopolitan in spirit; his prejudices were personal and highly original, usually against the prejudices of his <em>moment and milieu.</em> Hawthorne is less provincial, in the derogatory sense, than his charming biographer, Mr. James, as will become evident if one compares Hawthorne&#39;s American notes on England, written in long ago days of national rancor, with Mr. James&#39;s British notes on America (&quot;The American Scene&quot;), written in our happy days of spacious vision.</p>
<p>Emerson&#39;s ensphering universality overspreads Carlyle like the sky above a volcanic island. Indeed Carlyle (who knew more about American life and about what other people ought to do than any other British writer earlier than Mr. Chesterton) justly complains that Emerson is not sufficiently local and concrete; Carlyle longs to see &quot;some Event, Man&#39;s Life, American Forest, or piece of creation which this Emerson loves and wonders at, well <em>Emersonised.</em>&quot; Longfellow would not stay at home and write more about the excellent village blacksmith; he made poetical tours of Europe and translated songs and legends from several languages for the delight of the villagers who remained behind. Lowell was so heartily cosmopolitan that American newspapers accused him of Anglomania—which proves their provincialism but acquits him. Mr. Howells has written a better book about Venice than about Ohio. Mark Twain lived in every part of America, from Connecticut to California, he wrote about every country under the sun (and about some countries beyond the sun), he is read by all sorts and conditions of men in the English-speaking world, and he is an adopted hero in Vienna. It is difficult to come to any conclusion about provincialism as a characteristic of American literature.</p>
<p>American literature is on the whole idealistic, sweet, delicate, nicely finished. There is little of it which might not have appeared in the <em>Youth&#39;s Companion.</em> The notable exceptions are our most stalwart men of genius, Thoreau, Whitman, and Mark Twain. Any child can read American literature, and if it does not make a man of him, it at least will not lead him into forbidden realms. Indeed, American books too seldom come to grips with the problems of life, especially the books cast in artistic forms. The essayists, expounders, and preachers attack life vigorously and wrestle with the meaning of it. The poets are thin, moonshiny, meticulous in technique. Novelists are few and feeble, and dramatists are non-existent. These generalities, subject to exceptions, are confirmed by a reading of the first fifteen volumes of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, which are a treasure-house of the richest period of American literary expression. In those volumes one finds a surprising number of vigorous, distinguished papers on politics, philosophy, science, even on literature and art. Many talented men and women, whose names are not well remembered, are clustered there about the half dozen salient men of genius; and the collection gives one a sense that the New England mind (aided by the outlying contributors) was, in its one Age of Thought, an abundant and diversified power. But the poetry is not memorable, except for some verses by the few standard poets. And the fiction is na�ve. Edward Everett Hale&#39;s &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; is almost the only story there that one comes on with a thrill either of recognition or of discovery.</p>
<p>It is hard to explain why the American, except in his exhortatory and passionately argumentative moods, has not struck deep into American life, why his stories and verses are, for the most part, only pretty things, nicely unimportant. Anthony Trollope had a theory that the absence of international copyright threw our market open too unrestrictedly to the British product, that the American novel was an unprotected infant industry; we printed Dickens and the rest without paying royalty and starved the domestic manufacturer. This theory does not explain. For there were many American novelists, published, read, and probably paid for their work. The trouble is that they lacked genius; they dealt with trivial, slight aspects of life; they did not take the novel seriously in the right sense of the word, though no doubt they were in another sense serious enough about their poor productions. &quot;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&quot; and &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; are colossal exceptions to the prevailing weakness and superficiality of American novels.</p>
<p>Why do American writers turn their backs on life, miss its intensities, its significance? The American Civil War was the most tremendous upheaval in the world after the Napoleonic period. The imaginative reaction on it consists of some fine essays, Lincoln&#39;s addresses, Whitman&#39;s war poetry, &quot;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&quot; (which came before the war but is part of it), one or two passionate hymns by Whittier, the second series of the &quot;Biglow Papers,&quot; Hale&#39;s &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot;—and what else? The novels laid in war-time are either sanguine melodrama or absurd idyls of maidens whose lovers are at the front—a tragic theme if tragically and not sentimentally conceived. Perhaps the bullet that killed Theodore Winthrop deprived us of our great novelist of the Civil War, for he was on the right road. In a general speculation such a might-have-been is not altogether futile; if Milton had died of whooping cough there would not have been any &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;; the reverse of this is that some geniuses whose works ought inevitably to have been produced by this or that national development may have died too soon. This suggestion, however, need not be gravely argued. The fact is that the American literary imagination after the Civil War was almost sterile. If no books had been written, the failure of that conflict to get itself embodied in some masterpieces would be less disconcerting. But thousands of books were written by people who knew the war at first hand and who had literary ambition and some skill, and from all these books none rises to distinction.</p>
<p>An example of what seems to be the American habit of writing about everything except American life, is the work of General Lew Wallace. Wallace was one of the important secondary generals in the Civil War, distinguished at Fort Donelson and at Shiloh. After the war he wrote &quot;Ben-Hur,&quot; a doubly abominable book, because it is not badly written and it shows a lively imagination. There is nothing in it so valuable, so dramatically significant as a week in Wallace&#39;s war experiences. &quot;Ben-Hur,&quot; fit work for a country clergyman with a pretty literary gift, is a ridiculous inanity to come from a man who has seen the things that Wallace saw! It is understandable that the man of experience may not write at all, and, on the other hand, that the man of secluded life may have the imagination to make a military epic. But for a man crammed with experience of the most dramatic sort and discovering the ability and the ambition to write—for him to make spurious oriental romances which achieve an enormous popularity! The case is too grotesque to be typical, yet it is exceptional in degree rather than in kind. The American literary artist has written about everything under the skies except what matters most in his own life. General Grant&#39;s plain autobiography, not art and of course not attempting to be, is better literature than most of our books in artistic forms, because of its intellectual integrity and the profound importance of the subject-matter.</p>
<p>Our dreamers have dreamed about many wonderful things, but their faces have been averted from the mightier issues of life. They have been high-minded, fine-grained, eloquent in manner, in odd contrast to the real or reputed vigor and crudeness of the nation. In the hundred years from Irving&#39;s first romance to Mr. Howells&#39;s latest unromantic novel, most of our books are eminent for just those virtues which America is supposed to lack. Their physique is feminine; they are fanciful, dainty, reserved; they are literose, sophisticated in craftsmanship, but innocently unaware of the profound agitations of American life, of life everywhere. Those who strike the deeper notes of reality, Whitman, Thoreau, Mark Twain, Mrs. Stowe in her one great book, Whittier, Lowell and Emerson at their best, are a powerful minority. The rest, beautiful and fine in spirit, too seldom show that they are conscious of contemporaneous realities, too seldom vibrate with a tremendous sense of life.</p>
<p>The Jason of western exploration writes as if he had passed his life in a library. The Ulysses of great rivers and perilous seas is a connoisseur of Japanese prints. The warrior of &#39;Sixty-one rivals Miss Marie Corelli. The mining engineer carves cherry stones. He who is figured as gaunt, hardy and aggressive, conquering the desert with the steam locomotive, sings of a pretty little rose in a pretty little garden. The judge, haggard with experience, who presides over the most tragi-comic divorce court ever devised by man, writes love stories that would have made Jane Austen smile.</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold Bennett is reported to have said that if Balzac had seen Pittsburgh, he would have cried: &quot;Give me a pen!&quot; The truth is, the whole country is crying out for those who will record it, satirize it, chant it. As literary material, it is virgin land, ancient as life and fresh as a wilderness. American literature is one occupation which is not over-crowded, in which, indeed, there is all too little competition for the new-comer to meet. There are signs that some earnest young writers are discovering the fertility of a soil that has scarcely been scratched.</p>
<p>American fiction shows all sorts of merit, but the merits are not assembled, concentrated; the fine is weak, and the strong is crude. The stories of Poe, Hawthorne, Howells, James, Aldrich, Bret Harte, are admirable in manner, but they are thin in substance, not of large vitality. On the other hand, some of the stronger American fictions fail in workmanship; for example, &quot;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin,&quot; which is still vivid and moving long after its tractarian interest has faded; the novels of Frank Norris, a man of great vision and high purpose, who attempted to put national economics into something like an epic of daily bread; and Herman Melville&#39;s &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; a madly eloquent romance of the sea. A few American novelists have felt the meaning of the life they knew and have tried sincerely to set it down, but have for various reasons failed to make first-rate novels; for example, Edward Eggleston, whose stories of early Indiana have the breath of actuality in them; Mr. E. W. Howe, author of &quot;The Story of a Country Town&quot;; Harold Frederic, a man of great ability, whose work was growing deeper, more significant when he died; George W. Cable, whose novels are unsteady and sentimental, but who gives a genuine impression of having portrayed a city and its people; and Stephen Crane, who, dead at thirty, had given in &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; and &quot;Maggie&quot; the promise of better work. Of good short stories America has been prolific. Mrs. Wilkins-Freeman, Mrs. Annie Trumbull Slosson, Sarah Orne Jewett, Rowland Robinson, H. C. Bunner, Edward Everett Hale, Frank Stockton, Joel Chandler Harris, and &quot;O. Henry&quot; are some of those whose short stories are perfect in their several kinds. But the American novel, which multiplies past counting, remains an inferior production.</p>
<p>On a private shelf of contemporary fiction and drama in the English language are the works of ten British authors, Mr. Galsworthy, Mr. H. G. Wells, Mr. Arnold Bennett, Mr. Eden Phillpotts, Mr. George Moore, Mr. Leonard Merrick, Mr. J. C. Snaith, Miss May Sinclair, Mr. William De Morgan, Mr. Maurice Hewlett, Mr. Joseph Conrad, Mr. Bernard Shaw, yes, and Mr. Rudyard Kipling. Beside them I find but two Americans, Mrs. Edith Wharton and Mr. Theodore Dreiser. There may be others, for one cannot pretend to know all the living novelists and dramatists. Yet for every American that should be added, I would agree to add four to the British list. However, a contemporary literature that includes Mrs. Wharton&#39;s &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; and Mr. Dreiser&#39;s &quot;Jennie Gerhardt&quot; both published last year, is not to be despaired of.</p>
<p>In the course of a century a few Americans have said in memorable words what life meant to them. Their performance, put together, is considerable, if not imposing. Any sense of dissatisfaction that one feels in contemplating it is due to the disproportion between a limited expression and the multifarious immensity of the country. Our literature, judged by the great literatures contemporaneous with it, is insufficient to the opportunity and the need. The American Spirit may be figured as petitioning the Muses for twelve novelists, ten poets, and eight dramatists, to be delivered at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<h3>SOME NONSENSE ABOUT A DOG</h3>
<h3>Harry Esty Dounce</h3>
<h4>Harry Esty Dounce was born in Syracuse in 1889 and graduated from Hamilton College in 1910. His first job was as a cub reporter on the journal that newspapermen affectionately call &quot;the old <em>Sun</em>&quot;; the adjective is pronounced as though it were in italics. He was on the staff of the Syracuse <em>Herald</em>, 1912-14; spent a year in New Orleans writing short stories, and returned in 1916 to the magazine staff of the Sun. He was editor of the Sun&#39;s book review section, 1919-20; in 1920 he joined the staff of the New York <em>Evening Post</em>.</h4>
<p>&quot;My hand will miss the insinuated nose—&quot;</p>
<p><em>Sir William Watson</em>.</p>
<p>BUT the dog that was written of must have been a big dog. Nibbie was just a comfortable lapful, once he had duly turned around and curled up with his nose in his tail.</p>
<p>This is for people who know about dogs, in particular little mongrels without pedigree or market value. Other people, no doubt, will find it disgustingly maudlin. I would have found it so before Nibbie came.</p>
<p>The day he came was a beautiful bright, cool one in an August. A touring car brought him. They put him down on our corner, meaning to lose him, but he crawled under the car, and they had to prod him out and throw stones before they could drive on. So that when I came home I found, with his mistress-elect, a sort of potbellied bundle of tarry oakum, caked with mud, panting convulsively still from fright, and showing the whites of uncommonly liquid brown eyes and a pink tongue. There was tennis that evening and he went along—I carried him over the railroad tracks; he gave us no trouble about the balls, but lay huddled under the bench where she sat, and shivered if a man came near him.</p>
<p>That night he got chop bones and she got a sensible homily on the unwisdom of feeding strays, and he was left outdoors. He slept on the mat. The second morning we thought he had gone. The third, he was back, wagging approval of us and intent to stay, which seemed to leave no choice but to take him in. We had fun over names. &quot;Jellywaggles,&quot; suggested from next door, was undeniably descriptive. &quot;Rags&quot; fitted, or &quot;Toby&quot; or &quot;Nig&quot;—but they had a colored maid next door; finally we called him &quot;Nibs,&quot; and soon his tail would answer to it.</p>
<p>Cleaned up—scrubbed, the insoluble matted locks clipped from his coat, his trampish collar replaced with a new one bearing a license tag—he was far from being unpresentable. A vet. once opined that for a mongrel he was a good dog, that a black cocker mother had thrown her cap over Scottish mills, so to speak. This analysis accounted for him perfectly. Always, depending on the moment&#39;s mood, he was either terrier or spaniel, the snap and scrap and perk of the one alternating with the gentle snuggling indolence of the other.</p>
<p>As terrier he would dig furiously by the hour after a field mouse; as spaniel he would &quot;read&quot; the breeze with the best nose among the dog folk of our neighborhood, or follow a trail quite well. I know there was retrieving blood. A year ago May he caught and brought me, not doing the least injury, an oriole that probably had flown against a wire and was struggling disabled in the grass.</p>
<p>Nibbie was shabby-genteel black, sunburnt as to the mustache, grizzled as to the raggy fringe on his haunches. He had a white stock and shirt-frill and a white fore paw. The brown eyes full of heart were the best point. His body coat was rough Scottish worsted, the little black pate was cotton-soft like shoddy, and the big black ears were genuine spaniel silk. As a terrier he held them up smartly and carried a plumy fishhook of a tail; as a spaniel the ears drooped and the tail swung meekly as if in apology for never having been clipped. The other day when we had to say good-by to him each of us cut one silky tuft from an ear, very much as we had so often when he&#39;d been among the burdocks in the field where the garden is.</p>
<p>Burrs were by no means Nibbie&#39;s only failing. In flea time it seemed hardly possible that a dog of his size could sustain his population. We finally found a true flea bane, but, deserted one day, he was populous again the next. They don&#39;t relish every human; me they did; I used to storm at him for it, and he used, between spasms of scratching, to listen admiringly and wag. We think he supposed his tormentors were winged insects, for he sought refuge in dark clothes-closets where a flying imp wouldn&#39;t logically come.</p>
<p>He was wilful, insisted on landing in laps when their makers wanted to read. He <em>would</em> make advances to visitors who were polite about him. He <em>would</em> get up on the living-room table, why and how, heaven knows, finding his opportunity when we were out of the house, and taking care to be upstairs on a bed—white, grimeable coverlets preferred—by the time we had the front door open; I used to slip up to the porch and catch through a window the diving flourish of his sinful tail.</p>
<p>One of his faults must have been a neurosis really. He led a hard life before we took him in, as witnessed the game hind leg that made him sit up side-saddle fashion, and two such scars on his back as boiling hot grease might have made. And something especially cruel had been done to him when asleep, for if you bent over him napping or in his bed he would half rouse and growl, and sometimes snap blindly. (We dreaded exuberant visiting children.) Two or three experiments I hate to remember now convinced me that it couldn&#39;t be whipped out of him, and once wide awake he was sure to be perplexedly apologetic.</p>
<p>He was spoiled. That was our doing. We babied him abominably—he was, for two years, the only subject we had for such malpractice. He had more foolish names than Wogg, that dog of Mrs. Stevenson&#39;s, and heard more Little Language than Stella ever did, reciprocating by kissing proffered ears in his doggy way. Once he had brightened up after his arrival, he showed himself ready to take an ell whenever we gave an inch, and he was always taking them, and never paying penalties. He had conscience enough to be sly. I remember the summer evening we stepped outside for just an instant, and came back to find a curious groove across the butter, on the dining table, and an ever-so-innocent Nibbie in a chair in the next room.</p>
<p>While we were at the table he was generally around it, bulldozing for tid-bits—I fear he had reason to know that this would work. One fortnight when his Missie was away he slept on his Old Man&#39;s bed (we had dropped titles of dignity with him by then) and he rang the welkin hourly, answering far-away dog friends, and occasionally came north to lollop my face with tender solicitude, just like the fool nurse in the story, waking the patient up to ask if he was sleeping well.</p>
<p>More recently, when a beruffled basket was waiting, he developed an alarming trick of stealing in there to try it, so I fitted that door with a hook, insuring a crack impervious to dogs. And the other night I had to take the hook, now useless, off; we couldn&#39;t stand hearing it jingle. He adopted the junior member on first sight and sniff of him, by the way; would look on beaming as proudly as if he&#39;d hatched him.</p>
<p>The last of his iniquities arose from a valor that lacked its better part, an absurd mixture of Falstaff and bantam rooster. At the critical point he&#39;d back out of a fuss with a dog of his own size. But let a police dog, an Airedale, a St. Bernard, or a big ugly cur appear and Nibbie was all around him, blackguarding him unendurably. It was lucky that the big dogs in our neighborhood were patient. And he never would learn about automobiles. Usually tried to tackle them head on, often stopped cars with merciful drivers. When the car wouldn&#39;t stop, luck would save him by a fraction of an inch. I couldn&#39;t spank that out of him either. We had really been expecting what finally happened for two years.</p>
<p>That&#39;s about all. Too much, I am afraid. A decent fate made it quick the other night, and clean and close at hand, in fact, on the same street corner where once a car had left the small scapegrace for us. We tell ourselves how glad we are it happened as it did, instead of an agonal ending such as many of his people come to. We tell ourselves we couldn&#39;t have had him for ever in any event; that some day, for the junior member&#39;s sake, we shall get another dog. We keep telling ourselves these things, and talking with animation on other topics. The muzzle, the leash, the drinking dish are hidden, the last muddy paw track swept up, the nose smudges washed off the favorite front window pane.</p>
<p>But the house is full of a little snoofing, wagging, loving ghost. I know how the boy Thoreau felt about a hereafter with dogs barred. I want to think that somewhere, some time, I will be coming home again, and that when the door opens Nibbie will be on hand to caper welcome.</p>
<p>THE FIFTY-FIRST DRAGON  </p>
<p><em>By</em> Heywood Broun</p>
<p>Heywood Broun, who has risen rapidly through the ranks of newspaper honor from sporting reporter and war correspondent to one of the most highly regarded dramatic and literary critics in the country, is another of these Harvard men, but, as far as this book is concerned, the last of them. Broun graduated from Harvard in 1910; was several years on the New York <em>Tribune</em>, and is now on the <em>World</em>.</p>
<p>There is no more substantially gifted newspaper man in his field; his beautifully spontaneous humor and drollery are counterbalanced by a fine imaginative sensitiveness and a remarkable power in the fable or allegorical essay, such as the one here reprinted. His book, <em>Seeing Things at Night</em>, is only the first-fruit of truly splendid possibilities. If I may be allowed to prophesy, thus hazarding all, I will say that Heywood Broun is likely, in the next ten or fifteen years, to do as fine work, both imaginative and critical, as any living American of his era.</p>
<p>OF all the pupils at the knight school Gawaine le Cœur-Hardy was among the least promising. He was tall and sturdy, but his instructors soon discovered that he lacked spirit. He would hide in the woods when the jousting class was called, although his companions and members of the faculty sought to appeal to his better nature by shouting to him to come out and break his neck like a man. Even when they told him that the lances were padded, the horses no more than ponies and the field unusually soft for late autumn, Gawaine refused to grow enthusiastic. The Headmaster and the Assistant Professor of Pleasaunce were discussing the case one spring afternoon and the Assistant Professor could see no remedy but expulsion.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the Headmaster, as he looked out at the purple hills which ringed the school, &quot;I think I&#39;ll train him to slay dragons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He might be killed,&quot; objected the Assistant Professor.</p>
<p>&quot;So he might,&quot; replied the Headmaster brightly, but he added, more soberly, &quot;we must consider the greater good. We are responsible for the formation of this lad&#39;s character.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are the dragons particularly bad this year?&quot; interrupted the Assistant Professor. This was characteristic. He always seemed restive when the head of the school began to talk ethics and the ideals of the institution.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve never known them worse,&quot; replied the Headmaster. &quot;Up in the hills to the south last week they killed a number of peasants, two cows and a prize pig. And if this dry spell holds there&#39;s no telling when they may start a forest fire simply by breathing around indiscriminately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would any refund on the tuition fee be necessary in case of an accident to young Cœur-Hardy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; the principal answered, judicially, &quot;that&#39;s all covered in the contract. But as a matter of fact he won&#39;t be killed. Before I send him up in the hills I&#39;m going to give him a magic word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; said the Professor. &quot;Sometimes they work wonders.&quot;</p>
<p>From that day on Gawaine specialized in dragons. His course included both theory and practice. In the morning there were long lectures on the history, anatomy, manners and customs of dragons. Gawaine did not distinguish himself in these studies. He had a marvelously versatile gift for forgetting things. In the afternoon he showed to better advantage, for then he would go down to the South Meadow and practise with a battle-ax. In this exercise he was truly impressive, for he had enormous strength as well as speed and grace. He even developed a deceptive display of ferocity. Old alumni say that it was a thrilling sight to see Gawaine charging across the field toward the dummy paper dragon which had been set up for his practice. As he ran he would brandish his ax and shout &quot;A murrain on thee!&quot; or some other vivid bit of campus slang. It never took him more than one stroke to behead the dummy dragon.</p>
<p>Gradually his task was made more difficult. Paper gave way to papier-m�ch� and finally to wood, but even the toughest of these dummy dragons had no terrors for Gawaine. One sweep of the ax always did the business. There were those who said that when the practice was protracted until dusk and the dragons threw long, fantastic shadows across the meadow Gawaine did not charge so impetuously nor shout so loudly. It is possible there was malice in this charge. At any rate, the Headmaster decided by the end of June that it was time for the test. Only the night before a dragon had come close to the school grounds and had eaten some of the lettuce from the garden. The faculty decided that Gawaine was ready. They gave him a diploma and a new battle-ax and the Headmaster summoned him to a private conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit down,&quot; said the Headmaster. &quot;Have a cigarette.&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine hesitated.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I know it&#39;s against the rules,&quot; said the Headmaster. &quot;But after all, you have received your preliminary degree. You are no longer a boy. You are a man. To-morrow you will go out into the world, the great world of achievement.&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine took a cigarette. The Headmaster offered him a match, but he produced one of his own and began to puff away with a dexterity which quite amazed the principal.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you have learned the theories of life,&quot; continued the Headmaster, resuming the thread of his discourse, &quot;but after all, life is not a matter of theories. Life is a matter of facts. It calls on the young and the old alike to face these facts, even though they are hard and sometimes unpleasant. Your problem, for example, is to slay dragons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They say that those dragons down in the south wood are five hundred feet long,&quot; ventured Gawaine, timorously.</p>
<p>&quot;Stuff and nonsense!&quot; said the Headmaster. &quot;The curate saw one last week from the top of Arthur&#39;s Hill. The dragon was sunning himself down in the valley. The curate didn&#39;t have an opportunity to look at him very long because he felt it was his duty to hurry back to make a report to me. He said the monster, or shall I say, the big lizard?—wasn&#39;t an inch over two hundred feet. But the size has nothing at all to do with it. You&#39;ll find the big ones even easier than the little ones. They&#39;re far slower on their feet and less aggressive, I&#39;m told. Besides, before you go I&#39;m going to equip you in such fashion that you need have no fear of all the dragons in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;d like an enchanted cap,&quot; said Gawaine.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; answered the Headmaster, testily.</p>
<p>&quot;A cap to make me disappear,&quot; explained Gawaine.</p>
<p>The Headmaster laughed indulgently. &quot;You mustn&#39;t believe all those old wives&#39; stories,&quot; he said. &quot;There isn&#39;t any such thing. A cap to make you disappear, indeed! What would you do with it? You haven&#39;t even appeared yet. Why, my boy, you could walk from here to London, and nobody would so much as look at you. You&#39;re nobody. You couldn&#39;t be more invisible than that.&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine seemed dangerously close to a relapse into his old habit of whimpering. The Headmaster reassured him: &quot;Don&#39;t worry; I&#39;ll give you something much better than an enchanted cap. I&#39;m going to give you a magic word. All you have to do is to repeat this magic charm once and no dragon can possibly harm a hair of your head. You can cut off his head at your leisure.&quot;</p>
<p>He took a heavy book from the shelf behind his desk and began to run through it. &quot;Sometimes,&quot; he said, &quot;the charm is a whole phrase or even a sentence. I might, for instance, give you &#39;To make the&#39;—No, that might not do. I think a single word would be best for dragons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A short word,&quot; suggested Gawaine.</p>
<p>&quot;It can&#39;t be too short or it wouldn&#39;t be potent. There isn&#39;t so much hurry as all that. Here&#39;s a splendid magic word: &#39;Rumplesnitz.&#39; Do you think you can learn that?&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine tried and in an hour or so he seemed to have the word well in hand. Again and again he interrupted the lesson to inquire, &quot;And if I say &#39;Rumplesnitz&#39; the dragon can&#39;t possibly hurt me?&quot; And always the Headmaster replied, &quot;If you only say &#39;Rumplesnitz,&#39; you are perfectly safe.&quot;</p>
<p>Toward morning Gawaine seemed resigned to his career. At daybreak the Headmaster saw him to the edge of the forest and pointed him to the direction in which he should proceed. About a mile away to the southwest a cloud of steam hovered over an open meadow in the woods and the Headmaster assured Gawaine that under the steam he would find a dragon. Gawaine went forward slowly. He wondered whether it would be best to approach the dragon on the run as he did in his practice in the South Meadow or to walk slowly toward him, shouting &quot;Rumplesnitz&quot; all the way.</p>
<p>The problem was decided for him. No sooner had he come to the fringe of the meadow than the dragon spied him and began to charge. It was a large dragon and yet it seemed decidedly aggressive in spite of the Headmaster&#39;s statement to the contrary. As the dragon charged it released huge clouds of hissing steam through its nostrils. It was almost as if a gigantic teapot had gone mad. The dragon came forward so fast and Gawaine was so frightened that he had time to say &quot;Rumplesnitz&quot; only once. As he said it, he swung his battle-ax and off popped the head of the dragon. Gawaine had to admit that it was even easier to kill a real dragon than a wooden one if only you said &quot;Rumplesnitz.&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine brought the ears home and a small section of the tail. His school mates and the faculty made much of him, but the Headmaster wisely kept him from being spoiled by insisting that he go on with his work. Every clear day Gawaine rose at dawn and went out to kill dragons. The Headmaster kept him at home when it rained, because he said the woods were damp and unhealthy at such times and that he didn&#39;t want the boy to run needless risks. Few good days passed in which Gawaine failed to get a dragon. On one particularly fortunate day he killed three, a husband and wife and a visiting relative. Gradually he developed a technique. Pupils who sometimes watched him from the hill-tops a long way off said that he often allowed the dragon to come within a few feet before he said &quot;Rumplesnitz.&quot; He came to say it with a mocking sneer. Occasionally he did stunts. Once when an excursion party from London was watching him he went into action with his right hand tied behind his back. The dragon&#39;s head came off just as easily.</p>
<p>As Gawaine&#39;s record of killings mounted higher the Headmaster found it impossible to keep him completely in hand. He fell into the habit of stealing out at night and engaging in long drinking bouts at the village tavern. It was after such a debauch that he rose a little before dawn one fine August morning and started out after his fiftieth dragon. His head was heavy and his mind sluggish. He was heavy in other respects as well, for he had adopted the somewhat vulgar practice of wearing his medals, ribbons and all, when he went out dragon hunting. The decorations began on his chest and ran all the way down to his abdomen. They must have weighed at least eight pounds.</p>
<p>Gawaine found a dragon in the same meadow where he had killed the first one. It was a fair-sized dragon, but evidently an old one. Its face was wrinkled and Gawaine thought he had never seen so hideous a countenance. Much to the lad&#39;s disgust, the monster refused to charge and Gawaine was obliged to walk toward him. He whistled as he went. The dragon regarded him hopelessly, but craftily. Of course it had heard of Gawaine. Even when the lad raised his battle-ax the dragon made no move. It knew that there was no salvation in the quickest thrust of the head, for it had been informed that this hunter was protected by an enchantment. It merely waited, hoping something would turn up. Gawaine raised the battle-ax and suddenly lowered it again. He had grown very pale and he trembled violently. The dragon suspected a trick. &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; it asked, with false solicitude.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve forgotten the magic word,&quot; stammered Gawaine.</p>
<p>&quot;What a pity,&quot; said the dragon. &quot;So that was the secret. It doesn&#39;t seem quite sporting to me, all this magic stuff, you know. Not cricket, as we used to say when I was a little dragon; but after all, that&#39;s a matter of opinion.&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine was so helpless with terror that the dragon&#39;s confidence rose immeasurably and it could not resist the temptation to show off a bit.</p>
<p>&quot;Could I possibly be of any assistance?&quot; it asked. &quot;What&#39;s the first letter of the magic word?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It begins with an &#39;r,&#39;&quot; said Gawaine weakly.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; mused the dragon, &quot;that doesn&#39;t tell us much, does it? What sort of a word is this? Is it an epithet, do you think?&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine could do no more than nod.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, of course,&quot; exclaimed the dragon, &quot;reactionary Republican.&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; said the dragon, &quot;we&#39;d better get down to business. Will you surrender?&quot;</p>
<p>With the suggestion of a compromise Gawaine mustered up enough courage to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;What will you do if I surrender?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, I&#39;ll eat you,&quot; said the dragon.</p>
<p>&quot;And if I don&#39;t surrender?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll eat you just the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then it doesn&#39;t mean any difference, does it?&quot; moaned Gawaine.</p>
<p>&quot;It does to me,&quot; said the dragon with a smile. &quot;I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t surrender. You&#39;d taste much better if you didn&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>The dragon waited for a long time for Gawaine to ask &quot;Why?&quot; but the boy was too frightened to speak. At last the dragon had to give the explanation without his cue line. &quot;You see,&quot; he said, &quot;if you don&#39;t surrender you&#39;ll taste better because you&#39;ll die game.&quot;</p>
<p>This was an old and ancient trick of the dragon&#39;s. By means of some such quip he was accustomed to paralyze his victims with laughter and then to destroy them. Gawaine was sufficiently paralyzed as it was, but laughter had no part in his helplessness. With the last word of the joke the dragon drew back his head and struck. In that second there flashed into the mind of Gawaine the magic word &quot;Rumplesnitz,&quot; but there was no time to say it. There was time only to strike and, without a word, Gawaine met the onrush of the dragon with a full swing. He put all his back and shoulders into it. The impact was terrific and the head of the dragon flew away almost a hundred yards and landed in a thicket.</p>
<p>Gawaine did not remain frightened very long after the death of the dragon. His mood was one of wonder. He was enormously puzzled. He cut off the ears of the monster almost in a trance. Again and again he thought to himself, &quot;I didn&#39;t say &#39;Rumplesnitz&#39;!&quot; He was sure of that and yet there was no question that he had killed the dragon. In fact, he had never killed one so utterly. Never before had he driven a head for anything like the same distance. Twenty-five yards was perhaps his best previous record. All the way back to the knight school he kept rumbling about in his mind seeking an explanation for what had occurred. He went to the Headmaster immediately and after closing the door told him what had happened. &quot;I didn&#39;t say &#39;Rumplesnitz,&#39;&quot; he explained with great earnestness.</p>
<p>The Headmaster laughed. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found out,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes you ever so much more of a hero. Don&#39;t you see that? Now you know that it was you who killed all these dragons and not that foolish little word &#39;Rumplesnitz.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine frowned. &quot;Then it wasn&#39;t a magic word after all?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; said the Headmaster, &quot;you ought to be too old for such foolishness. There isn&#39;t any such thing as a magic word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you told me it was magic,&quot; protested Gawaine. &quot;You said it was magic and now you say it isn&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t magic in a literal sense,&quot; answered the Headmaster, &quot;but it was much more wonderful than that. The word gave you confidence. It took away your fears. If I hadn&#39;t told you that you might have been killed the very first time. It was your battle-ax did the trick.&quot;</p>
<p>Gawaine surprised the Headmaster by his attitude. He was obviously distressed by the explanation. He interrupted a long philosophic and ethical discourse by the Headmaster with, &quot;If I hadn&#39;t of hit &#39;em all mighty hard and fast any one of &#39;em might have crushed me like a, like a—&quot; He fumbled for a word.</p>
<p>&quot;Egg shell,&quot; suggested the Headmaster.</p>
<p>&quot;Like a egg shell,&quot; assented Gawaine, and he said it many times. All through the evening meal people who sat near him heard him muttering, &quot;Like a egg shell, like a egg shell.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day was clear, but Gawaine did not get up at dawn. Indeed, it was almost noon when the Headmaster found him cowering in bed, with the clothes pulled over his head. The principal called the Assistant Professor of Pleasaunce, and together they dragged the boy toward the forest.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;ll be all right as soon as he gets a couple more dragons under his belt,&quot; explained the Headmaster.</p>
<p>The Assistant Professor of Pleasaunce agreed. &quot;It would be a shame to stop such a fine run,&quot; he said. &quot;Why, counting that one yesterday, he&#39;s killed fifty dragons.&quot;</p>
<p>They pushed the boy into a thicket above which hung a meager cloud of steam. It was obviously quite a small dragon. But Gawaine did not come back that night or the next. In fact, he never came back. Some weeks afterward brave spirits from the school explored the thicket, but they could find nothing to remind them of Gawaine except the metal parts of his medals. Even the ribbons had been devoured.</p>
<p>The Headmaster and the Assistant Professor of Pleasaunce agreed that it would be just as well not to tell the school how Gawaine had achieved his record and still less how he came to die. They held that it might have a bad effect on school spirit. Accordingly, Gawaine has lived in the memory of the school as its greatest hero. No visitor succeeds in leaving the building to-day without seeing a great shield which hangs on the wall of the dining hall. Fifty pairs of dragons&#39; ears are mounted upon the shield and underneath in gilt letters is &quot;Gawaine le Cœur-Hardy,&quot; followed by the simple inscription, &quot;He killed fifty dragons.&quot; The record has never been equaled.</p>
