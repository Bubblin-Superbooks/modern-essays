<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Hilaire Belloc—son of a French father and an English mother; his happy junction of both English and French genius in prose is hereditary—was born in France in 1870. He lived in Sussex as a child; served in the French field artillery; was at Balliol College, Oxford, 1893-95, and sat four years (1906-10) in the House of Commons. Certainly you must read (among his gatherings of essays) <em>On Nothing</em>, <em>On Everything</em>, <em>On Something</em>, <em>Hills and the Sea</em>, <em>First and Last</em>; then you can read <em>The Path to Rome</em>, and <em>The Four Men</em>, and <em>Caliban's Guide to Letters</em> and <em>The Pyrenees</em> and <em>Marie Antoinette</em>. If you desire the bouillon (or bullion) of his charm, there is <em>A Picked Company</em>, a selection (by Mr. E. V. Lucas) of his most representative work. It is published by Methuen and Company, 36 Essex Street W. C., London.</p><p>Having done so, come again: we will go off in a corner and talk about Mr. Belloc.</p></div> </div>
