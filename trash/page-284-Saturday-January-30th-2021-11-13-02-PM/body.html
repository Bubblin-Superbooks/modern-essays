<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">comedy, <em>Mr. Pim Passes By</em>, recently played a prosperous run in New York. "A Word for Autumn" is from his volume <em>Not That It Matters</em>.</p><p>LAST night the waiter put the celery on with the cheese, and I knew that summer was indeed dead. Other signs of autumn there may be—the reddening leaf, the chill in the early-morning air, the misty evenings—but none of these comes home to me so truly. There may be cool mornings in July; in a year of drought the leaves may change before their time; it is only with the first celery that summer is over.</p><p>I knew all along that it would not last. Even in April I was saying that winter would soon be here. Yet somehow it had begun to seem possible lately that a miracle might happen, that summer might drift on and on through the months—a final upheaval to crown a wonderful year. The celery settled that. Last night with the celery autumn came into its own.</p></div> </div>
