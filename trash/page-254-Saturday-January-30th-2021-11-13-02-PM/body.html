<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>America And The English Tradition</h3><h4>Harry Morgan Ayres</h4><p class="  start-chapter">This admirable summary of Anglo-American history first appeared (February, 1920) as an editorial in the <em>Weekly Review</em>. It seemed to me then, and still does, as a model in that form of writing, perfect in lucidity, temperance and good sense. Mr. Ayres is a member of the faculty of Columbia University (Department of English) and also one of the editors of the <em>Weekly Review</em>. Beowulf, Chaucer, Shakespeare and Seneca seem to be his favorite hobbies.</p></div> </div>
