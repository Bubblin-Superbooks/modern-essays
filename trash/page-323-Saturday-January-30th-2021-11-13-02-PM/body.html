In his later years, after the death of Miss Savage, in periods of loneliness, depression and ill-health, Butler made notes on his correspondence reproaching himself for his ill-treatment of her. "He also," says his biographer, "tried to express his remorse" in two sonnets from which I extract some lines:</p><p>She was too kind, wooed too persistently,</p><p>Wrote moving letters to me day by day;</p><p>Hard though I tried to love I tried in vain,</p><p>For she was plain and lame and fat and short,</p><p>Forty and overkind.</p><p>'Tis said that if a woman woo, no man</p><p>Should leave her till she have prevailed; and, true,</p><p>A man will yield for pity if he can,</p><p>But if the flesh rebel what can he do?</p><p>I could not; hence I grieve my whole life long</p><p>The wrong I did in that I did no wrong.</p></div> </div>
